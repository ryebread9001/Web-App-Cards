# Web-App-Cards

## Game is located here at: http://lyssie.org

# Overview

This project was an attempt to create a web app that could allow for a proper high score table for my JavaScript game. I ended up deciding to use nodejs with express to handle the server. It was a learning experience to create a backend and frontend that interfaced with each other.

The actual game is quite simple. I created a script that simulates drawing from a deck of cards. Each card adds to your total score however some cards may double or completely wipe out your score. It's up to the player when they want to "stay" and submit their score. You can always continue playing while running the risk of being set back to 0.

This game and project is available for view at http://lyssie.org
<sub><sup>the server has crashed on my before so I can't guaruntee it will be working 24/7</sup></sub>

I began this project with the hope of learning more about using tools such as fetch and node as well as to learn the basics of SQL databases.

# Web Pages

The pages for this project are the game and the high score table. The table is dynamically created by setting values for each player.

# Development Environment

I used vim and Visual Studio code to build this app.

I wrote nearly everything in JavaScript. There is an obvious little amount of HTML and CSS to build the page.

# Future Work

* The High Score table needs to be cleaned up to look better
* The user could include more info
* Use cookies to identify users by session
